This website was designed for one of the most visited art museums in the world. It provides essential information, including opening hours, current exhibitions (both in-person and online), and contact details. The development process incorporated a variety of modern web technologies to ensure a responsive and visually appealing design. We utilized **flexbox** and **CSS grid** for layout management, implemented the **BEM methodology** for structured and maintainable code, and styled the site using **SASS** for efficient CSS preprocessing. Additionally, **CSS transformations** and other advanced techniques were applied to enhance the user experience and create a polished, professional look.
